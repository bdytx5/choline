would it be a good idea to use github as a backend similar to how banana dev uses it? I'm worried 

it would add extra complexity to the system, which the entire goal of this project is to simplify.


as far as technical infrastructure goes, would it be good to be integrated with github? 

pros 
- we can easily version our training files, and link this to different runs. This could offer advantages for pausing/resuming runs. 
- less storage for us 

cons 
- increased complexity for storing files 
- increased complexity for user to need to link their git, especially if the system commits autonomously
