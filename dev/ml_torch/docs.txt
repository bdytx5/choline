the goal is to be able to not only sync models on a sever in between epochs
but also load from the server and resume a previous run, maintaining all previous run information (like it was never interrupted) 


this is the main objective right now. There will be other stuff that could be cool, but this is the core pain point for me right now 







in order to ensure loading from a pretrained model, the model will need to be tested for seemless loading from a .pth model -- otherwise restarting wont work. 
the library will need to know the run id in order to fetch the model for the run when starting again after a failure
