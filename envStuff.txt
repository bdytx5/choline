so the user local env needs to be recreated on a server 

i personally have never got into using docker. I understand pip and linux, and my guess is most devs / researchers do too. i admire the simplicity of requirements.txt . and they are saying config files arent sexy?!?! -- idk, I guess the simplicity of the requirments.txt in comparison to a dockerfile is whats attractive? 



my initial thought is the system / env info could be fetched automatically using some sort of script in the choline run command phase (haha idk if thats a thing?),
and essentially this would be used in one of two ways .... 


-----> AUTOMATICALLY create a docker env FOR the user and deploy automatically 


-----> compile the users env and just ship the binary to a server with similar specs as the users machine 



-----> (yuky) allow the user to make their own dockerfile / custom choline config 




both of these probably have their own set of issues. im a container n00b i guess. the goal is to always be a n00b, just be less of a n00b 


its these sorts of projects where i really see the gaps in my own knowledge. its one thing to know something is probably feasible, but to actually know for sure is another
