lets not kid ourselfs, the future of software is about software writing software 


andrej karpathy once coined the term "Software 2.0" where instead of writing if statements,
we train neural nets 


im coining the term "Software Squared" or "Software^2" 
this is software writing itself 

we will have to keep a watchful eye over this expontential technology. current tools are insufficient. 

github manages code, who mangages compute (money)? 

will jira be effective for ai agents?

how does one programmer manage 100 ai agents? 

what is the role of a programmer in the software^2 era? 

do we give ai agent A 1M dollars to build our system or do we go for agent B at 1.5M? 

do we make our own agent or do we use someone elses? 

what agent will work best for us? We dont want to fine tune on a sub-optimal agent backbone.
