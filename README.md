we must simplify 


choline.pro


best to read txt's in order of [idk, gameplan, envstuff] 

t0d0 
- figure out how to create a docker container reliably from a script that runs on the users local machine
- build machine provisioner that finds a machine for the user and starts it up - i guess use vast.ai 
- build server functionality that automatically syncs models to some other location in between epochs
- build fail detection and rollover system that syncs progress with previous run 
- build torch model wrappers (unless other solution is found) that automates model saving
- possibly build wrapper for torch dataset that solved discussed dataset paths that reside outside of the project
- build website, payment console, and CLI login / account infrastructure
